Potent nature mages do not die easily, and even death might not stop the more powerful ones. When the worms and bugs that feed of carrion devour the corpse of a dead Nature mage, some of the mages manage to transfer a portion of their mind and power into the crawling mass feeding on their remains. This being houses the life force of such a mage and it is formed by thousands of worms and bugs. Should it be slain in combat it can usually transfer its life force to other nearby bugs and shape a new body capable of casting spells.
