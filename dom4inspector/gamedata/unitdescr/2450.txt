The Horned One is a giant of divine heritage once put in charge of the wild by a previous Pantokrator. As lord of beasts, berserkers and wild revelry he is also known as the Horny One. When he made an attempt on a mistress of the Pantokrator he was trapped in a magic forest for eternity, with beasts as only company. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the Horned One has found a way out of his woodland prison to once more revel in the world. The Horned one is always followed by wild animals.
