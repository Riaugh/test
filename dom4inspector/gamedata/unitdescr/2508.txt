Agarthan legends tell of a time when the Earth made Flesh begot offspring with the greatest of olms. It is true that the great olms aided the pale ones in a distant past, but with the war of the Kin-Breaker the olms vanished into the deeper earth, never to be seen again. However, their legacy remains. Before the Kin-Breaker War an Oracle of Subterranean Waters gave birth to a swarm of strange larvae with the upper bodies of a Pale One and the lower parts of a Great Olm. A few of her offspring survived the breaking of the Seal and begot offspring of their own. The olm spawns have received status similar to the ancient ones, and many of them are trained as sacred guardians of the deeper halls. Since the breaking of the Seal, broken shards of ancient obsidian glaives are found in the caverns near the cursed chamber. These cursed obsidian shards are used to craft weapons for the Shard Guards, who have shown a remarkable resistance to the dark influence of the shards.
