The Nazcans are mainly descendants of the raptor clan. When civil war broke out in Caelum Nazca broke free and a raptorian kingdom was formed under the rule of the last Eagle King. But soon society was divided in two lines, the Hanan moiety and the less numerous dark winged Hurin moiety. The Aucac Runa are professional soldiers of the Sun Kingdom. The Aucac Runa of the Hanan moiety traditionally use short hand weapons such as maces and hatchets. When the first Eagle Kings arrived in what would become Nazca, iron working was still unknown. The Aucac Runa mostly use armors and weapons of cloth and bronze. Stone maces and bronze hatchets are the most common weapons. The caelian tribes have intermingled in Nazca, and most have some resistance to cold.
