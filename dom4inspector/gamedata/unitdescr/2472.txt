Life underneath the waves corresponds in many ways to that on dry land. Both humans and animals have underwater counterparts. Tritons are the most common of the aquatic humanoids and they appear as humans with legs ending in fins. This triton makes a living by ambushing travelers and stealing their valuables, just like their brigand counterparts on land.
