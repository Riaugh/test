The Muuch are descendants of the Atlantians that invaded the Xibalban caverns after the great flood. They resemble toads and have become known as toad men, although they have some fish-like traits as well. The magic of the star that fell into the ocean and flooded Xibalba transformed the atlantians. Or perhaps it was the will of the Awakening God that manifested itself. However, the Muuch have become more toadlike since they settled in the flooded caverns and some have evolved other traits previously not found in Atlantis. The Muuch use primitive armors. The coral used by their atlantian ancestors doesn't grown in the flooded caves. With recent contact and trade with Mictlan and other surface dwelling men, metal scaled armors have been adopted.
