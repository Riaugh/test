All forests will start to whisper the hymns to the pretender that controls this enchantment. This will spread dominion to the places where false pretenders were worshiped. When a forest has the right dominion it will start to attack instead of whispering hymns. Enemies in that province or neighboring provinces will be attacked by forest creatures. A strong dominion or high growth scale helps the effectiveness of the attacks and wastelands are never attacked by the forest creatures. The spell lasts until someone dispels it or the caster dies.
