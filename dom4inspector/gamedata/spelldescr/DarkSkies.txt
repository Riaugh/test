Black clouds billow forth and cover the lands of your Dominion.  All enemies under your Dominion will perceive the heavens as dark and oppressing. The stronger the Dominion is, the more fearful the skies. The dark skies severely lower the morale of those affected. The enchantment lasts until it is dispelled or the caster dies. The darkness also gives slightly lowered attack and defense skills to units without darkvision.
