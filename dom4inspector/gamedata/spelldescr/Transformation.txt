The caster is transformed into a random monster. Some monsters, such as fire drakes, are closely attuned to an element or other magical path. If the caster successfully transforms into such a being he might gain magic power. Also the casters new body is young and healthy. The transformation is not without risk, however, as the caster's mind and body may be damaged in the process. A luck scale increases the chance that the transformation is successful.
