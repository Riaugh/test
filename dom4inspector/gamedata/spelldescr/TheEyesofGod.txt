This enchantment enables the mage to see all provinces in the world. Dominions can be seen in great detail and so can discovered magic sites, but income cannot be determined exactly. Inside the God's own Dominion troop movements can be seen in great detail and enemy illusions and phantasms are dispelled. Patrolling units will find it much easier to detect enemy scouts and to quell unrest. The historic records for all nations can also be accessed. The enchantment lasts until someone dispels it or the caster dies.
