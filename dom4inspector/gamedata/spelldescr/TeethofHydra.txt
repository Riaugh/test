The caster prepares a field with unholy enchantments. He then sows the field with the teeth of dead hydras. During the following months, skeletal warriors will emerge from the ground and heed their maker's call. Five Longdead will emerge from the ground each month. The more magical gems the caster invests in the spell, the longer it will last. Each extra gem increases the duration by one season. -- funkar ej Ã¤nnu.
