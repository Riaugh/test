The shamans of the wolf tribes are known to craft effigies from wood and the bones of beasts and fallen enemies. These effigies project the memories of the bones and are surrounded by the spirits of the dead. Spectral beasts and warriors appear in the vicinity of the army, fooling scouts and spies that observe the army. An army with an effigy will appear to be 50 units larger than it actually is.
