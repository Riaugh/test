This stolen piece of the Sun contains enormous power that can be used for Astral and Fire magic. The Sun material is very sought after by astral beings and in combat the Forbidden Light will shine with a holy light that slays undead and blinds everyone else. The wielder of the Forbidden Light will grow older at an accelerated age, but that is unlikely to be his cause of death as many Horrors also seek possession of this precious item.
