The Blood mage sacrifices nearly threescore slaves to get the attention of Infernal powers. When contact is made, he signs his name in blood upon a contract with the Infernal Lord. From then on, the Blood mage will receive one bound devil each month. The devils are gifts from the Infernal Lord in exchange for the soul of the mage, which is taken when he dies.
