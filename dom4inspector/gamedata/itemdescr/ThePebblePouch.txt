A rather nondescript pouch made of cured Jotun skin. The pebble pouch's powers will be revealed when the user withdraws one of the pebbles that lies inside the pouch. Once the pebble is withdrawn it will grow in size to a large boulder, ready to be thrown. This item can only be used by those of giant size and strength.
